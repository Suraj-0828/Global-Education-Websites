                                        <p>
                                            Spanish, or Español, is a Romance language that originated in the Iberian Peninsula of Europe and is now the second most spoken native language in the world after Mandarin Chinese. It is the official language of 21 countries, primarily in Latin America and Spain, and is spoken by over 460 million people as their first language.

                                        <ol>
                                            <li><strong>Grammar:</strong> Spanish has a subject-verb-object sentence structure, but verb conjugation plays a significant role in determining tense, mood, and subject.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Alphabet:</strong> It uses the Latin alphabet with 27 letters (including the "ñ").</li>
                                            <li><strong>Pronunciation:</strong> Most of its letters have consistent sounds, making pronunciation more predictable than in English.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Gender:</strong> Nouns in Spanish are either masculine or feminine, and adjectives must agree in gender and number with the nouns they describe.</li>
                                        </ol>
