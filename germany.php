                                        <p>
                                            German (Deutsch) is the official language of Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and parts of other European countries. It is one of the world's major languages and is part of the Germanic branch of the Indo-European language family, closely related to English and Dutch. German is known for its rich vocabulary, compound words, and grammatical structure, which includes gendered nouns, cases (nominative, accusative, dative, and genitive), and a unique verb conjugation system.
